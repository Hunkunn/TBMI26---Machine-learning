function epsilon = getepsilon(episode, maxEpisodes)
% GETEPSILON returns epsilon (exploration factor) given several parameters,
% e.g. the current and total number of episodes. You may choose not to use
% this function but it might be helpful if you would like to plot how
% epsilon changes during the training. If you choose to use this function
% you are free to add or remove any parameters. However, the current inputs
% episode and maxEpisodes are hints that these parameters might be good to
% use when defining epsilon.
