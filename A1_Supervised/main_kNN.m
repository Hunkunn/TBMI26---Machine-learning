% 2 = dot cloud 2
% 3 = dot cloud 3
% 4 = OCR data

plotCase(X,D)

% Note: XBins, DBins, LBins will be cell arrays, to extract a single bin from them use e.g.
% XBin1 = XBins{1};
%
% Or use the combineBins helper function to combine several bins into one matrix (good for cross validataion)

%  Note: you have to modify the kNN() function yourself.

% Set the number of neighbors

% Classify training data

% Classify test data

%% Calculate The Confusion Matrix and the Accuracy
%  Note: you have to modify the calcConfusionMatrix() and calcAccuracy()
%  functions yourself.classes  = unique(LTrue);

% The confucionMatrix
cM = calcConfusionMatrix(LPredTest, LTest)

% The accuracy
acc = calcAccuracy(cM)

%% Plot classifications
%  Note: You should not have to modify this code
